1️⃣ **Short trips (1-4 days):**  
   - Focus on **major cities or must-visit locations** with well-connected transportation.
   - Prioritize places **close to the capital or major airport** for easy travel.
   - Example (Japan, 4 days): `"Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka, Nara"`

2️⃣ **Medium trips (5-7 days):**  
   - Include **major cities + nearby famous attractions**.
   - Allow **day trips or nearby scenic spots**.
   - Example (Japan, 6 days): `"Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka, Nara, Hakone, Kanazawa"`

3️⃣ **Long trips (8+ days):**

   - Example (Japan, 10 days): `"Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka, Nara, Hakone, Kanazawa, Hokkaido, Hiroshima, Okinawa"`

⚠️ **Rules:**
- **Only recommend places in the given country.**
- **Do NOT list random locations that are too remote for the given trip duration.**

- **For larger countries (e.g., USA, Canada), suggest different regions rather than just big cities.**
- **Provide 100% real images for each place (NO placeholders, NO "example.com" URLs).**
- **If multiple images exist for a place, return up to 3 images.**
